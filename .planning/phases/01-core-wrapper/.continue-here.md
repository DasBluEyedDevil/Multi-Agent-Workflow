<current_state>
Phase 1 plan execution is COMPLETE (01-01-PLAN.md fully executed, SUMMARY written, STATE and ROADMAP updated). The execute-phase orchestrator was interrupted AFTER Wave 1 completed but BEFORE running the phase verification step.

What remains is the execute-phase tail: verify phase goal, update requirements, commit phase completion docs, and present next steps.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Plan 01-01: Write complete kimi.agent.wrapper.sh — DONE (commit 5deca7c)
- Plan 01-01: Validate wrapper against success criteria — DONE (commit 32ad0a9)
- Plan 01-01: Metadata commit (SUMMARY, STATE, ROADMAP) — DONE (commit 2c941f7)
- ROADMAP.md: Phase 1 marked Complete with date 2026-02-04
- STATE.md: Updated to show Phase 1 complete, 1/1 plans done
- 01-01-SUMMARY.md: Created with full execution details
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
The execute-phase orchestrator needs to finish its tail steps:

1. **Verify phase goal** — Spawn gsd-verifier to check Phase 1 must_haves against actual codebase (config has verifier: true). Creates VERIFICATION.md.
2. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md** — Mark Phase 1 requirements (WRAP-01, WRAP-02, WRAP-03, WRAP-08, WRAP-10, WRAP-12, WRAP-13) as Complete.
3. **Commit phase completion** — Bundle VERIFICATION.md and REQUIREMENTS.md updates.
4. **Offer next steps** — Present Phase 2 planning prompt.

Alternatively: just run `/gsd:execute-phase 1` again — it will detect 01-01-SUMMARY.md exists, skip execution, and proceed to verification.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Model profile: quality (executor=opus, verifier=sonnet)
- Branching strategy: none (working on main)
- commit_docs: true (planning artifacts committed to git)
- All Phase 1 implementation decisions logged in STATE.md (exit codes 10-13, default model kimi-for-coding, unknown flags passthrough, piped stdin, version check as warning only)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Phase 1 execution succeeded cleanly.

<context>
This is a 6-phase project building a Claude Code plugin that integrates Kimi CLI as an R&D subagent. Phase 1 delivered the core wrapper script (skills/kimi.agent.wrapper.sh, 282 lines). The wrapper handles CLI detection, version checking, agent file resolution, argument parsing, and clean invocation with --quiet mode.

The execute-phase workflow was running `/gsd:execute-phase 1` and had completed Wave 1 (the only wave) when paused. The remaining steps are all orchestrator-level (verification, requirements update, next-step routing) — no more code to write for Phase 1.

Phase 2 (Agent Roles) is next and needs planning via `/gsd:discuss-phase 2` or `/gsd:plan-phase 2`.
</context>

<next_action>
Option A (recommended): Run `/gsd:execute-phase 1` to finish verification and phase-completion steps. It will skip the already-completed plan and run verifier + cleanup.

Option B: Skip verification and go straight to Phase 2 with `/gsd:discuss-phase 2` or `/gsd:plan-phase 2`.
</next_action>
