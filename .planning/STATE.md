# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Claude Code users can delegate any R&D task to Kimi K2.5 -- research, analysis, implementation, debugging, refactoring -- while Claude stays in the architect seat.
**Current focus:** Phase 7: Fix Installer Agent MD (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 7 (Fix Installer Agent MD) - COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 completed (07-01 Add Agent MD Copying)
Status: GAP CLOSURE COMPLETE
Last activity: 2026-02-05 -- Completed 07-01-PLAN.md (Fix Installer Agent MD)

Progress: [############] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 12
- Average duration: ~4 minutes
- Total execution time: ~43 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-core-wrapper | 1/1 | ~6 min | ~6 min |
| 02-agent-roles | 3/3 | ~20 min | ~6.7 min |
| 03-prompt-assembly | 3/3 | ~10 min | ~3.3 min |
| 04-developer-experience | 2/2 | ~5 min | ~2.5 min |
| 05-claude-code-integration | 2/2 | ~5 min | ~2.5 min |
| 06-distribution | 3/3 | ~9 min | ~3 min |
| 07-fix-installer-agent-md | 1/1 | ~1 min | ~1 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 06-02 (~1 min), 06-01 (~4 min), 06-03 (~2 min), 07-01 (~1 min)
- Trend: Fast execution on gap closure

*All 12 plans executed including gap closure*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All decisions from project execution:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 39 requirements (WRAP/ROLE/INTG/DIST categories)
- [Roadmap]: Agent roles separated from core wrapper to allow independent testing via `kimi --agent-file`
- [Roadmap]: Prompt assembly (Phase 3) depends only on Phase 1, enabling parallel work with Phase 2
- [01-01]: Exit codes 10-13 for wrapper errors; 1-9 reserved for kimi CLI propagation
- [01-01]: Default model is kimi-for-coding (inherits user's kimi config mapping)
- [01-01]: Unknown flags pass through to kimi CLI (future-compatible)
- [01-01]: Piped stdin supported as prompt source; positional arg takes precedence
- [01-01]: Version check is warning only, not hard block
- [02-01]: Analysis roles use exclude_tools in YAML for runtime enforcement (not just prompt instructions)
- [02-01]: All 7 roles share identical output format: SUMMARY/FILES/ANALYSIS/RECOMMENDATIONS
- [02-01]: Agent prompts use section ordering: Identity → Objective → Process → Output → Constraints
- [02-01]: Analysis roles exclude: Shell, WriteFile, StrReplaceFile, SetTodoList, CreateSubagent, Task
- [02-02]: Action roles have NO exclude_tools (full read/write/execute access)
- [02-02]: Debugger role requires audit trail: "Commands executed" section in ANALYSIS
- [02-02]: Implementer role has greenfield freedom: can introduce new patterns regardless of existing conventions
- [02-02]: All 7 agent roles (3 analysis + 4 action) are now complete and ready for integration
- [02-03]: All 7 agents verified: YAML valid, loadable via kimi CLI, correct tool restrictions, structured output confirmed
- [03-01]: Template structure follows Context-Task-Output Format-Constraints sections
- [03-01]: Template variables use Kimi CLI native syntax: ${KIMI_WORK_DIR}, ${KIMI_NOW}, ${KIMI_MODEL}
- [03-01]: Exit code 14 added for template not found (consistent with role not found pattern)
- [03-01]: Machine-parseable header extended to [kimi:role:template:model]
- [03-02]: Git diff injection uses `git diff HEAD` for staged + unstaged changes
- [03-02]: Git errors (unavailable, not a repo) show warning but continue execution
- [03-02]: Context file search order: .kimi/context.md first, KimiContext.md as fallback
- [03-02]: Missing context file silently continues (no error, no warning)
- [03-02]: Prompt assembly order: Template → Context → Diff → User prompt
- [03-03]: All WRAP-04 through WRAP-07 requirements verified PASS
- [03-03]: Verification report created with comprehensive test evidence
- [03-03]: Phase 3 complete, ready for Phase 4: Developer Experience
- [04-02]: Dry-run exits with code 0 (success) for valid command preview
- [04-02]: Prompt preview truncates at 200 chars with total char count displayed
- [04-02]: log_verbose() pattern established for conditional debug output
- [04-01]: Pass-through flags only pass the flag itself (not assumed values)
- [04-01]: Dynamic role/template enumeration via list_available_roles() and list_available_templates()
- [04-01]: --thinking documented as example pass-through flag in script header
- [05-02]: SKILL.md kept compact at 1,941 chars (well under 3,000 limit)
- [05-02]: Command table uses ./skills/ path for project-relative invocation
- [05-01]: Slash commands use bash invocation (not PowerShell) for cross-platform compatibility
- [05-01]: kimi-trace documents full tool access (unlike read-only analysis roles)
- [05-01]: kimi-verify emphasizes ALWAYS including --diff flag
- [06-02]: Bash resolution order: Git Bash > WSL > MSYS2 > Cygwin > PATH
- [06-02]: WSL path conversion: C:\path → /mnt/c/path
- [06-02]: kimi.ps1 placed in project root for easy discovery
- [06-01]: Extended existing install.sh/uninstall.sh vs separate scripts (supports both Gemini and Kimi)
- [06-01]: CLI argument parsing for non-interactive installs (--global, --local, --target, --force)
- [06-01]: Dry-run mode in uninstall.sh for safe preview of removals
- [06-03]: Comprehensive 486-line README covering all components
- [06-03]: Restored accidentally deleted .kimi/agents/ files (14 files from commit 7d29c51)
- [07-01]: Mirrored exact pattern from YAML copy block for consistency

### Pending Todos

None - project complete.

### Blockers/Concerns

All concerns addressed:
- [Research]: Kimi CLI version instability -- addressed with version check on startup (warns, not blocks)
- [Research]: Windows PATH loss after system updates -- addressed with KIMI_PATH env var override
- [Research]: Scope creep risk -- 530 lines in wrapper, within reasonable budget
